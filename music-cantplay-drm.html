<p class="p">If you downloaded some music from an online store you may find that it won't play on your computer, especially if you bought it on a Windows or Mac OS computer and then copied it over.</p>
<p class="p">This could be because the music is in a format that is not recognized by your computer. To be able to play a song you need to have support for the right audio formats installed - for example, if you want to play MP3 files, you need MP3 support installed. If you don't have support for a given audio format, you should see a message telling you so when you try to play a song. The message should also provide instructions for how to install support for that format so that you can play it.</p>
<p class="p">If you do have support installed for the song's audio format but still can't play it, the song might be <span class=" em">copy protected</span> (also known as being <span class=" em">DRM restricted</span>). DRM is a way of restricting who can play a song and on what devices they can play it. The company that sold the song to you is in control of this, not you. If a music file has DRM restrictions, you will probably not be able to play it - you generally need special software from the vendor to play DRM restricted files, but few of these are supported on Linux.</p>
<p class="p">You can learn more about DRM from the <span class=" link"><a href="http://www.eff.org/issues/drm" title="http://www.eff.org/issues/drm">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a></span>.</p>
