<p class="p">After you have backed up your files, you should make sure that the 
backup was successful. If it didn't work properly, you could lose important 
data since some files could be missing from the backup.</p>
<p class="p">When you use the file manager to copy or move files, the 
computer checks to make sure that all of the data transferred correctly.  
However, if you are transferring data that is very important to you, 
you may want to perform additional checks to confirm that your 
data has been transferred properly.</p>
<p class="p">You can do an extra check by looking through the copied files 
and folders on the destination media. By checking to make sure that the files and folders you transferred are actually there in the backup, you can have extra confidence that the process was
successful.</p>
<div class="note note-tip"><div class="inner"><div class="contents"><p class="p">If you find that you do regular backups of large amounts of data, you may find it easier to 
use a dedicated backup program, such as <span class=" app">Déjà Dup</span>. Such a program is more powerful and more reliable than 
just copying and pasting files.</p></div></div></div>
