<p class="p">If your audio player (MP3 player etc.) is plugged in to the computer but you can't see it in your music organizer application, it may not have been properly recognized as an audio player.</p>
<p class="p">Try unplugging the player and then plugging it in again. If that doesn't help, open the File Manager. You should see the player listed under <span class=" gui">Devices</span> in the sidebar - click it to open the folder for the audio player. Now, click <span class=" guiseq"><span class=" gui">File</span> ▸ <span class=" gui">New Document</span> ▸ <span class=" gui">Empty Document</span></span>, type <span class=" input">.is_audio_player</span> and press <span class=" key">Enter</span> (the period and underscores are important, and it should be all lower-case). This file tells your computer to recognize the device as an audio player.</p>
<p class="p">Now, find the audio player in the File Manager sidebar and eject it (right-click and click <span class=" gui">Eject</span>). Unplug it, then plug it back in. This time it should have been recognized as an audio player by your music organizer. If not, try closing the music organizer and then re-opening it.</p>
<div class="note"><div class="inner"><div class="contents"><p class="p">These instructions won't work for iPods and some other audio players. They should work if your player is a <span class=" em">USB Mass Storage</span> device, though; it should say in its manual if it is.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="note"><div class="inner"><div class="contents"><p class="p">When you look in the audio player folder again, you won't see the <span class=" input">.is_audio_player</span> file. This is because the period in the file's name tells the File Manager to hide the file. You can check that it is still there by clicking <span class=" guiseq"><span class=" gui">View</span> ▸ <span class=" gui">Show Hidden Files</span></span>.</p></div></div></div>
