<p class="p">The word <span class=" em">volume</span> is used to describe a storage device, like a hard disk. It can also refer to a <span class=" em">part</span> of the storage on that device, because you can split the storage up into chunks. The computer makes this storage accessible via your file system in a process referred to as <span class=" em">mounting</span>. Mounted volumes may be hard drives, USB drives, DVD-RWs, SD cards, and other media. If a volume is currently mounted, you can read (and possibly write) files on it.</p>
<p class="p">Often, a mounted volume is called a <span class=" em">partition</span>, though they are not necessarily the same thing. A “partition” refers to a <span class=" em">physical</span> area of storage on a single disk drive. Once a partition has been mounted, it can be referred to as a volume because you can access the files on it. You can think of volumes as the labeled, accessible “storefronts” to the functional “back rooms” of partitions and drives.</p>

<p class="p">You can check and modify your computer's storage volumes with the disk utility.</p>
<div class="steps"><ol class="steps">
<li class="steps"><p class="p">Open the <span class=" gui">Activities</span> overview and start the <span class=" app">Disk Utility</span>.</p></li>
<li class="steps"><p class="p"> In the pane marked <span class=" gui">Storage Devices</span>, you will find hard disks, CD/DVD drives, and other physical devices. Click on the device you want to inspect.</p></li>
<li class="steps">
<p class="p"> In the right pane, the area labeled <span class=" gui">Volumes</span> provides a visual breakdown of the volumes and partitions present on the selected device. It also contains a variety of tools used to manage these volumes.</p>
<p class="p">Take care; it is possible to completely erase the data on your disk with these tools if you try to.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<p class="p">Your computer most likely has at least one <span class=" em">primary</span> partition and a single <span class=" em">swap</span> partition. The swap partition is used by the operating system for memory management, and is rarely mounted.  The primary partition contains your operating system, applications, settings, and personal files. These files can also be distributed among multiple partitions for security or convenience.</p>
<p class="p">One primary partition must contain information that your computer uses to start up, or <span class=" em">boot</span>. For this reason it is sometimes called a boot partition, or boot volume. To determine if a volume is bootable, look at its <span class=" gui">Partition Flags</span> in the disk utility. External media such as USB drives and CDs may also contain a bootable volume.</p>
