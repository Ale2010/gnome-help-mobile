<div class="contents">
<p class="p">You can connect computers together by forming an <span class=" em">ad-hoc</span> wireless network. This is useful if one of the computers has a printer connected to it that you want to share, or if you want to transfer files between them, for example. With a normal (<span class=" em">infrastructure</span>) wireless network, you would connect both computers to a network provided by wireless base station or router. If you don't have a base station, however, an ad-hoc network will still allow you to connect the computers to each other.</p>
<p class="p">To set-up an ad-hoc wireless network:</p>
<div class="steps"><ol class="steps">
<li class="steps"><p class="p">On one of the computers, click your name on the top bar and select <span class=" gui">System Settings</span>.</p></li>
<li class="steps"><p class="p">Open <span class=" gui">Network</span> and select <span class=" gui">Wireless</span> from the list on the left.</p></li>
<li class="steps"><p class="p">Go to the <span class=" gui">Wireless</span> tab and click <span class=" gui">Add</span>.</p></li>
<li class="steps"><p class="p">In the window that appears, choose a name for the wireless network and then go to the <span class=" gui">Wireless</span> tab.</p></li>
<li class="steps"><p class="p">Choose an <span class=" gui">SSID</span>. This is the name of the network that other people will be able to see.</p></li>
<li class="steps"><p class="p">Change the <span class=" gui">Mode</span> to <span class=" gui">Ad-hoc</span> and leave the other settings at their defaults. Click <span class=" gui">Save</span>.</p></li>
<li class="steps">
<p class="p">On the other computer, click the network icon on the top bar and look for a network with the SSID you chose. It might take a minute or two to appear in the list.</p>
<p class="p">Click it to connect to the ad-hoc network. Once connected, you will be able to access network shares and so on, like you would if both computers were connected to a conventional wireless network.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<p class="p">These instructions will be different if one of the computers is not running Linux. You may find it easiest to set-up the ad-hoc network on the Linux computer and connect to it using the other computer.</p>
<p class="p">Also note that some wireless network cards do not support ad-hoc networking, so you will not be able to use them to create an ad-hoc network.</p>

<div class="contents">
<p class="p">Anyone in the area will be able to connect to your ad-hoc network, so it's not very secure. You can add a <span class=" link"><a href="net-wireless-wepwpa.html" title="">WEP/WPA password</a></span> to the network to protect it from unauthorized access.</p>
<p class="p">To add a password:</p>
<div class="steps"><ol class="steps">
<li class="steps"><p class="p">Click the network icon on the top bar and click <span class=" gui">Edit Connections</span>.</p></li>
<li class="steps"><p class="p">Go to the <span class=" gui">Wireless</span> tab, select the ad-hoc wireless network and click <span class=" gui">Edit</span>.</p></li>
<li class="steps"><p class="p">Go to the <span class=" gui">Wireless Security</span> tab and change the <span class=" gui">Security</span> from <span class=" gui">None</span>. WPA is a good, secure choice, but some older wireless cards do not support it so you might have to use WEP instead.</p></li>
<li class="steps"><p class="p">Choose your own password and then click <span class=" gui">Save</span>. The other computers connected to the ad-hoc connection will have to reconnect and you'll have to enter the password on each of them.</p></li>
