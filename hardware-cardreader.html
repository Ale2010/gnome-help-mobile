<div class="contents">
<p class="p">Many computers contain readers for SD, MMC, SM, MS, CF, and other storage media 
cards. These should be automatically detected and <span class=" link"><a href="disk-partitions.html" title="">mounted</a></span>. Here are some 
troubleshooting steps if they are not:</p>
<div class="steps"><ol class="steps">
<li class="steps"><p class="p"> Make sure that the card is put in correctly. Many cards look as though they are 
upside down when correctly inserted. Also make sure that the card is firmly seated 
in the slot; some cards, especially CF, require a small amount of force to insert 
correctly. (Be careful not to push too hard! If you come up against something solid, 
do not force it.)</p></li>
<li class="steps"><p class="p"> Open <span class=" app">Files</span> by using the <span class=" gui">Activities</span> menu. Does the inserted
 card appear in the <span class=" gui">Devices</span> list in the left sidebar? Sometimes the card appears in this list but is not mounted; click it once to mount. (If the sidebar is not visible, press <span class=" key">F9</span> or click 
 <span class=" guiseq"><span class=" gui">View</span> ▸ <span class=" gui"> Sidebar</span> ▸ <span class=" gui"> Show Sidebar</span></span>.)
</p></li>
<li class="steps"><p class="p">If your card does not show up in the sidebar, click <span class=" guiseq"><span class=" gui">Go</span> ▸ <span class=" gui">Computer</span></span>. 
If your card reader is correctly configured, the reader should come up as a drive 
when no card is present, and the card itself when the card has been mounted (see the picture below).</p></li>
<li class="steps"><p class="p">If you see the card reader but not the card, the problem may be with the card itself. 
Try a different card or check the card on a different reader if possible.</p></li>
</ol></div>
<p class="p">If no cards or drives are available in the <span class=" gui">Computer</span> folder, 
it is possible that your card reader does not work with Linux due to driver issues. 
If your card reader is internal (inside the computer instead of sitting outside) 
this is more likely. The best solution is to directly connect your device 
(camera, cell phone, etc.) to a USB port on the computer. USB external card 
readers are also available, and are far better supported by Linux.</p>
