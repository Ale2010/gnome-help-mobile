<p class="p">When you check the remaining battery life, you may find that the <span class=" em">time remaining</span> it reports is different to how long the battery <span class=" em">actually</span> lasts. This is because the amount of remaining battery life can only be estimated. The estimates should get better over time, though.</p>
<p class="p">In order to estimate the remaining battery life, a number of factors must be taken into account. One is the amount of power currently being used by the computer: power consumption varies depending on how many programs you have open, which devices are plugged in, and whether you are running any intensive tasks (like watching a DVD or converting music files, for example). This changes from moment to moment, and is difficult to predict.</p>
<p class="p">Another factor is how the battery discharges. Some batteries lose charge faster the emptier they get. Without precise knowledge of how the battery discharges, only a rough estimate of remaining battery life can be made.</p>
<p class="p">As the battery discharges, the Power Manager will figure-out its discharge properties and will learn how to make better estimates of battery life. They will never be completely accurate, though.</p>
<div class="note"><div class="inner"><div class="contents">
<p class="p">If you get a completely ridiculous battery life estimate (say, hundreds of days!), the Power Manager is probably missing some of the data it needs to make a sensible estimate.</p>
<p class="p">If you unplug the power and run the laptop on battery for a while, then plug it in and let it recharge again, the Power Manager should be able to get the data it needs.</p>
