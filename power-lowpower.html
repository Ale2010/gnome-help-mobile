<p class="p">When the charge level of the battery gets too low, your computer will automatically hibernate (that is, it will save all of your open documents and applications, and then turn off). It does this to make sure that the battery doesn't completely discharge, since this is bad for the battery. If the battery just ran out, the computer wouldn't have time to shut down properly either.</p>
<p class="p">You can change what happens when the battery level gets too low by clicking your name at the top of the screen, selecting <span class=" gui">System Settings</span>, and then opening the <span class=" gui">Power</span> settings. Look at the <span class=" gui">When power is critically low</span> setting. You can choose for the computer to hibernate or shut down; if you choose shut down, your applications and documents <span class=" em">will not</span> be saved before the computer turn off.</p>
<p class="p">Some computers have problems hibernating, and may not be able to recover the applications and documents you had open when you turn on the computer again. In this case, it is possible that you could lose some of your work if you didn't save it before the computer hibernated. You may be able to <span class=" link"><a href="power-suspendfail.html" title="">fix problems with hibernation</a></span> though.</p>
