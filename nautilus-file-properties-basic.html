<p class="p">To view information about a file or folder, right-click it and select
  <span class=" gui">Properties</span>. You can also select the file and press
  <span class=" guiseq"><span class=" gui">Alt</span> ▸ <span class=" gui">Enter</span></span>.</p>
<p class="p">The file properties window shows you information like the type of file,
  the size of the file, and when you last modified it. If you need this 
  information often, you
  can have it displayed in <span class=" link"><a href="nautilus-list.html" title="">list view columns</a></span>
  or <span class=" link"><a href="nautilus-display.html#icon-captions" title="">icon captions</a></span>. You can 
  also use this window to 
  <span class=" link"><a href="nautilus-file-properties-permissions.html" title="">set file permissions</a></span>
  and <span class=" link"><a href="files-open.html" title="">choose applications to open files</a></span>.</p>
<p class="p">The information given on the <span class=" gui">Basic</span> tab is explained below. 
  There are also 
  <span class=" gui"><span class=" link"><a href="nautilus-file-properties-permissions.html" title="">Permissions</a></span></span> 
  and <span class=" gui"><span class=" link"><a href="files-open.html#default" title="">Open With</a></span></span> tabs. For 
  certain types of files, such as images and videos, there will be an extra tab 
  that provides information like the dimensions, duration, and codec.</p>

<dt class="terms"><span class=" gui">Name</span></dt>
<dd class="terms"><p class="p">You can rename the file by changing this field.
    You can also rename a file outside the properties window. See

<dt class="terms"><span class=" gui">Type</span></dt>
<dd class="terms">
<p class="p">This helps you identify the type of the file, such as PDF document, 
    OpenDocument Text, or JPEG image. The file type determines which 
    applications can open the file, amongst  other things. For example, you 
    can't open a picture with a music player. See <span class=" link"><a href="files-open.html" title="">Open files with other applications</a></span> 
    for more information on this.</p>
<p class="p">The <span class=" em">MIME type</span> of the file is shown in parentheses; MIME type is 
    a standard way that computers use to refer to the file type.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="terms">Contents</dt>
<dd class="terms"><p class="p">This field is displayed if you are looking at the properties of a folder rather than a file. It helps you see the number of items in the folder.  If the folder includes other folders, each inner folder is counted as one item, even if it contains further items. Each file is also counted as one item. If the folder is empty, the contents will display <span class=" gui">nothing</span>.</p></dd>
<dt class="terms">Size</dt>
<dd class="terms">
<p class="p">This field is displayed if you are looking at a file (not a folder). The size of a file tells you how much disk space it takes up. This is also an indicator of how long it will take to download a file or send it in an email (big files take longer to send/receive).</p>
<p class="p">Sizes may be given in bytes, KB, MB, or GB; in the case of the last three, the size in bytes will also be given in parentheses. Technically, 1 KB is 1024 bytes, 1 MB is 1024 KB and so on.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="terms">Location</dt>
<dd class="terms"><p class="p">The location of each file on your computer is given by its <span class=" em">absolute path</span>. This is a unique "address" of the file on your computer, made up of a list of the folders that you would need to go into to find the file. For example, if Jim had a file called <span class=" file">Resume.pdf</span> in his Home folder, its location would be <span class=" file">/home/jim/Resume.pdf</span>.</p></dd>
<dt class="terms">Volume</dt>
<dd class="terms"><p class="p">The file system or device that the file is stored on. This shows you
    where the file is physically stored, for example if it is on the hard disk 
    or on a CD, or a
    <span class=" link"><a href="nautilus-connect.html" title="">network share or file server</a></span>. Hard 
    disks can be split up into several 
    <span class=" link"><a href="disk-partitions.html" title="">disk partitions</a></span>; the partition will 
    be displayed under <span class=" gui">Volume</span> too.</p></dd>
<dt class="terms">Free Space</dt>
<dd class="terms"><p class="p">This is only displayed for folders. It gives the amount of disk space 
    which is available on the disk that the folder is on. This is useful for 
    checking if the hard disk is full.</p></dd>
<dt class="terms">Accessed</dt>
<dd class="terms"><p class="p">The date and time when the file was last opened.</p></dd>
<dt class="terms">Modified</dt>
