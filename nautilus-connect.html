<div class="contents">
<p class="p">You can connect to a server or network share to browse and
view files on that server, exactly as if they were on your
own computer. This is a convenient way to download or upload 
files on the internet, or to share files with other people on
your local network.</p>
<p class="p">To browse files over the network, open the <span class=" app">Files</span>
application from the <span class=" gui">Activities</span> overview. Then, click 
<span class=" gui">Browse Network</span> in the sidebar, or select
<span class=" gui">Network</span> from the <span class=" gui">Go</span> menu. The file manager
will find any computers on your local area network that advertise
their ability to serve files. If you want to connect to a server
on the internet, or if you do not see the computer you're looking
for, you can manually connect to a server by typing in its 
internet/network address.</p>
<div class="steps">
<div class="title title-steps"><h2><span class="title">Connect to a file server</span></h2></div>
<ol class="steps">
<li class="steps"><p class="p">In the file manager, click <span class=" guiseq"><span class=" gui">File</span> ▸ <span class=" gui">Connect to Server</span></span>.</p></li>
<li class="steps">
<p class="p">Enter the server address, select the type of server, and enter
  any additional information as required. Then click <span class=" gui">Connect</span>.
  Details on server types are <span class=" link"><a href="#types" title="">listed below</a></span>.</p>
<p class="p">For servers on the internet, you can usually use the domain name 
  (e.g. <span class=" sys">ftp.example.com</span>). For computers on your local network, 
  however, you may have to use the computer's 
  <span class=" link"><a href="net-findip.html" title="">numeric IP address</a></span>.</p>
</li>
<li class="steps">
<p class="p">A new window will open showing you the files on the server.
  You can browse the files just as you would for those on your own computer.</p>
<p class="p">The server will also be added to the sidebar so you can access it quickly 
  in the future</p>

<div class="hgroup"><h2 class="title">Different types of server</h2></div>
<div class="contents">
<p class="p">You can connect to different types of servers. Some servers
are public, and allow anybody to connect. Other servers require
you to log in with a user name and password.</p>
<p class="p">You may not have permissions to perform certain actions on files 
on a server. For example, on public FTP sites, you will probably not be
able to delete files.</p>
<div class="terms">
<div class="title title-terms"><h3><span class="title">Types of server</span></h3></div>
<dl class="terms">
<dt class="terms">SSH</dt>
<dd class="terms">
<p class="p">If you have a <span class=" em">secure shell</span> account on a server, you
  can connect using this method. Many web hosts provide SSH accounts
  to members so they can securely upload files. SSH servers always
  require you to log in. If you use a secure shell key to log in,
  leave the password field blank.</p>
<p class="p">When using SSH, all the data you send (including your password)
  is encrypted so that other users on your network can't see it.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="terms">FTP (with login)</dt>
<dd class="terms"><p class="p">FTP is a popular way of exchanging files on the Internet.
  Because data is not encrypted over FTP, many servers now provide
  access through SSH. Some servers, however, still allow or require
  you to use FTP to upload or download files. FTP sites with logins
  will usually allow you to delete and upload files.</p></dd>
<dt class="terms">Public FTP</dt>
<dd class="terms">
<p class="p">Sites that allow you to download files will sometimes provide
  public or anonymous FTP access. These servers do not require a
  user name and password, and will usually not allow you to delete
  or upload files.</p>
<p class="p">Some anonymous FTP sites require you to log in with a
  public user name and password, or with a public user name using
  your email address as the password. For these servers, use the
  <span class=" gui">FTP (with login)</span> method, and use the credentials
  specified by the FTP site.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="terms">Windows share</dt>
<dd class="terms"><p class="p">Windows computers use a proprietary protocol to share files over a local
  area network. Computers on a Windows network are sometimes grouped into
  <span class=" em">domains</span> for organization and to better control access. If you have
  the right permissions on the remote computer, you can connect to a Windows
  share from the file manager.</p></dd>
<dt class="terms">WebDAV and Secure WebDAV</dt>
<dd class="terms"><p class="p">Based on the HTTP protocol used on the web, WebDAV is sometimes used to
  share files on a local network and to store files on the internet. If the
  server you're connecting to supports secure connections, you should choose
  this option. Secure WebDAV uses strong SSL encryption, so that other users 
  can't see your password.</p></dd>
