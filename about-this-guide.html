<div class="contents">
<p class="p">This guide is designed to give you a tour of the features of your desktop, answer your computer-related questions, and provide tips on using your computer more effectively.We've tried to make this guide as easy to use as possible:</p>
<div class="list"><ul class="list">
<li class="list"><p class="p">The guide is sorted into small, task-oriented topics--not chapters. This means that you don't need to skim through an entire manual to find the answer to your questions.</p></li>
<li class="list"><p class="p">Related-items are linked together. "See-also" links at the bottom of some pages will direct you to related topics. This makes it easy to find similar topics that might help you perform a certain task.</p></li>
<li class="list"><p class="p">It includes built-in search. The bar at the top of the help browser is a <span class=" em">search bar</span>, and relevant results will start appearing as soon as you start typing.</p></li>
<li class="list"><p class="p">The guide is constantly being improved. Although we attempt to provide you with a comprehensive set of helpful information, we know we won't answer all of your questions here. We will keep adding more information to make things more helpful, though.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p class="p">Thank you for taking the time to read the desktop help. We sincerely hope that you will never have to use it.</p>
